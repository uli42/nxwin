ChangeLog:

nxwin-2.0.0-13

- The third button emulation is activated by default.

nxwin-2.0.0-12

- Hidden the X cursor when the pointer leaves the NXWin window.

nxwin-2.0.0-11

- Hidden the root cursor on the window border if multiwindow mode is
  on.

- Log file is created under '$NX_TEMP' instead of '$NX_ROOT/temp'.

- Moved the printing of pid and handler earlier in the log file.

nxwin-2.0.0-10

- Modified the default root cursor from the classical 'X' shape into
  an arrow.

- Implemented FR09C01037. Now it is possible to paste the text copied
  from a local Windows application in a X11 session both by pressing
  the middle button of the mouse and by using Ctrl-V.

nxwin-2.0.0-9

- Addded printing of a line in the log file reporting the pid and the
  window handler.

nxwin-2.0.0-8

- Added a call to CloseWellKnownConnections() before calling exit() in
  the dispatch loop. This makes the server remove the sockets before
  exiting.

nxwin-2.0.0-7

- Removed some unuseful log messages.

nxwin-2.0.0-6

- Fixed the procedure opening the log file. The standard error now
  points to the newly created log, so that we can share the same
  file for all the log facilities.

- The log is not closed at the server shutdown (but it is obviously
  closed at the the time we exit()), so that other components can
  keep using the file to print their log information.

nxwin-2.0.0-5

- Changed the format of some files from Dos to Unix.

nxwin-2.0.0-4

- Moved the call to exit(), introduced in the previous version, at the
  end of the dispatch loop.

nxwin-2.0.0-3

- It seems that there are still memory errors in the deinitialization
  phase, probably due to a double free or such. The code base is going
  to move forward to the X.org tree so there is not a pressing need to
  investigate the problem. If the client that is disconnecting is our
  only remaining client (that for a NX session is the proxy), then the
  dispatcher will exit without going through the normal close down
  procedure.

- Added some stubs in the NXwin.h header to preserve the independence
  of the NXWin package from the X11 libs.

nxwin-2.0.0-2

- Updated NoMachine copyright notice to the current year.

- NXWin.log is renamed to winlog and created under '$NX_ROOT/temp'
  path.

nxwin-2.0.0-1

- Opened the 2.0.0 branch based on the 1.5.0-8.

nxwin-1.5.0-8

- Fixed TR08C00970. Check if the data field of the property structure
  is NULL before trying to retrive the data.

nxwin-1.5.0-7

- Merged patch from Cygwin/XFree86 to stop printing the 
  IDirectDrawSurface4_Blt() failure messages after 10 times.

- Fixed TR10C01050. Added a check on a lParam bit of WM_KEYDOWN mes-
  sage in order to filter Windows autorepeat for modifier keys.

- Fixed a segmentation fault arising when disconnecting the nxagent in
  multiwindow mode.

- Fixed TR10C01095. In order to notify applications like OpenOffice or
  Gnome-Text-Editor that they have losen the selection, after select-
  ing some text in a Windows application by Ctrl-C,it's necessary sen-
  ding them a ClearSelecion event when they lose the focus.

nxwin-1.5.0-6

- Fixed TR08C00965. If a window had no WM icon defined, the icon of a
  sibling window became the default. Now use the NoMachine logo.

nxwin-1.5.0-5

- Fixed TR06C00918. Tell the server to flush the output in order to
  send a RequestSelection event immediately when the main window lose
  the keyboard focus.

nxwin-1.5.0-4

- Fixed a segmentation fault arising when shutting down the server in
  multiwindow mode.

nxwin-1.5.0-3

- Added special keystroke Ctrl-Alt-m to minimize the root window.

nxwin-1.5.0-2

- Removed the hardcoded value "/mnt/NX/fonts/rgb". It was overwriting
  the value passed as a command line parameter ("-co").

nxwin-1.5.0-1

- Opened the 1.5.0 branch.

nxwin-1.4.1-1

- Opened the 1.4.1 branch.

  or session suspension. If a older agent or a single application
  is detected failure will be notified to nxclient administrator.

- Opened the 1.4.0 branch.

nxwin-1.3.2-5

- Now when get the WM_CLOSE, send to all top level
  windows the wm_protocols WM_DELETE client message.

- Opened the 1.3.1 branch.
