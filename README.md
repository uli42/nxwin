This is a repository that stores all known source codes of NoMachine's
nxwin, an Xserver for Windows with special adaptations for use with
NoMachine NX.

The sources cannot be compiled standalone but require the Xserver
build infrastructure and source code.

Those sources are collected here to in order to preserve history.
